# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to the WebProtégé project!  You can contribute in a number of ways from filing bug reports through to code contributions.

We have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that contributors must abide to.  Please take some time to have a look at it.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub Issues to manage bug reports.  Before creating a bug report please have a quick look at [our issue tracker](/issues) to see if someone else has already filed an issue.

### How do I submit a Bug Report?

When you submit a bug report you should explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* If you can describe exactly what time the issue occurred, we can more confidently review our (rather large) logs to look for reports related to your issue.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, what you were trying to do and what you expected.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

Please include details about your configuration and environment:

* The name and version of the browser you're using
* Are you running a local version WebProtégé? If so, which version of the software are you using? Which operating system are you running?

We will assign the correct labels to your issue after reviewing your issue.

## Code Contributions

WebProtégé is written using Java and the Google Web Toolkit (GWT).  You can contribute by forking the GitHub repository and submitting a pull request.  

Once you have submitted a pull request we will review your code and test it.  We may require you to make some changes to your code or the documentaiton of your code.  You should include automated tests with your code.

### What can I work on?

Our [issue tracker](https://github.com/protegeproject/webprotege/issues) has a list of feature requests and bugs that need fixing.  You can use this as an inspiration for something to work on.  A number of the issues are tagged as "Good first issue".  These are some of the easier issues to tackle.  If you start working on an issue, please leave a comment in the issue discussion thread so that other people know you are working on the issue.  If you stop working on an issue please leave a comment in the thread so that we know.
