    <h1>WebProtégé Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        We abide by the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/site/privacy/">Standford Core Privacy Policy</a>. In addition
        to
        this we aide by the information below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>
        We reserve the right to share and distribute
        <u>OBFUSCATED</u> versions of your ontology and change history.
        By obfuscated, we mean that we remove all domain information by replacing
        entity (class, property and individual) names with meaningless identifiers (C1, C2, C3 etc.)
        and we remove any trace of user identifying information from the change history.
        Once obfuscated, only the original structure of the
        ontology and change history remains. We may redistribute this obfuscated data for
        research purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will <u>NOT</u> share or redistribute any original unobfuscated ontologies or content that you upload to,
        or edit at, webprotege.stanford.edu.  This includes project change history, discussion threads
        and other project data.
    </p>

    <h2>Account and Data Removal</h2>

    <p>
        The WebProtégé user interface does not offer a mechanism for account or project content removal.  If
        you would like us to delete your account and/or project content please send an email to
        webprotege-management@lists.stanford.edu.
